# men-stack-crud-app
The purpose of this App is to connect contractors with workers/helpers
As a user I can sign-up either as a contractor or as a worker
If a user creates a profile as a worker, he has to submit areas of preferable work and his skills set
If a user creates a profile as a contractor then he has to appoint a location for the job where he needs help and the skills necessary for the worker to perform the job
The contractors are the only ones that are able to create jobs in the application
The workers are then able to submit a request to a job
Jobs appear on the workers' profile based on location and skills they can perform
Rate/Payment is set between the contractor for the job, or for the day, or for the week, or the ammount of time the contractor requires the worker
After the job is complete the contractor can rate the performance of the worker and submit comments on the workers performance as well
Ratings are then used by the App to refer a worker when a new job is created by a contractor, giving him preference if his rating is high (5 Stars)
